# cat-website

A webpage to adopt cats. This is a static website to practice my skills in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, vanilla Javascript and JQ. I have used a different HTML and CSS (styles folder) file for each section: main page (index and styles), about, adopt and contact section. The JS and JQ code is in the JS folder. The images used in this website are in the img folder.

# Contact-page section

A contact form to send a message to the owner. It has different fields: Name, Email, Subject and Message. They have requirements:

- Name must be longer than 1 character.
- Email is validated by a standard regex for email validation.
- Subject must be equal or longer than 2 characters.
- Message must be equal or longer than 10 characters.

The validation happens when the user clicks the button "Envia". A message of error is displayed if one or more of this requirements have not been implemented. Moreover, it won't send the message if the contact form is empty. The contact form works with https://formspree.io/. The message is sent to the owner's email.
